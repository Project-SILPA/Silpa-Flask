SILPA
-----

SILPA is an acronym of Swathanthra(Mukth, Free as in Freedom) Indian
Language Processing Applications. Its a web framework written using
Flask micro framework for hosting various Indian language computing
algorithms written in python. It currently provides JSONRPC support
which is also used by web framework itself to input data and fetch
result.

The modules work as standalone python packages which will serve their
purpose and also they plug into the silpa-flask webframewok so that
they can be accessed as web services also, or become just another
webapp like the dictionary module.
