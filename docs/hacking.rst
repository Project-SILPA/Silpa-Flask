Guidelines for Coding and Pull Requests
-----------------------------------------------

1. Please follow PEP-8 standard for all python code, make sure your
   code is PEP-8 compilant before sending the PR.
2. Please fork our repository from github `organization project
   <https://github.com/Project-SILPA>`_.
3. Develop new feature bug fixes etc. on **separate branch, do not
   change things in master branch**.
4. When committing please commit changes atomically, i.e. all related
   changes should go in a single commit. Do not commit unrelated
   changes together.
5. Write tests, write more and more tests we love tests :-). Make sure
   your new features pass all tests before raising PR. (Obviously we
   don't need tests for documentation changes).
6. Keep the history clean, `squash or delete
   <http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html>`_
   unnecessary commits.
7. Write meaningful commit messages which explains the changes in
   commit. Consider adding sign-offs and mentioning issues fixed by
   commit (if any).
8. Write meaningful PR which explains changes and gives possible usage
   example.
9. If your commit passes all above then likelihood of your changes
   getting merged is more :-).
10. All commit will be checked and merged by the `core team
    <https://github.com/orgs/Project-SILPA/teams/core`_.
