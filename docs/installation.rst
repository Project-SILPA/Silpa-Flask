Install Instructions
========================

Note that this is currently a work in progress. So things may not work
as you expected it to work. If you want to test this you need to have
following installed on your system

* pip
* Virtualenv

Test deployment

.. code-block:: shell-session

    $ git clone https://github.com/Project-SILPA/Silpa-Flask.git
    $ cd Silpa-Flask
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    $ python silpa.py

If you want to Install all modules:

.. code-block:: shell-session

		$ pip install -r requirement-modules.txt

.. note:: Previously we were suggesting use of ``modules.txt`` but now
	  we are unable  properly update the pypi modules in time so
	  we suggest use of ``head`` of git repo. But note that this
	  might lead to some breakage.

To enable module a line should be added to *silpa.conf*. By default
all modules will be enabled if you don't want this behavior mark
``no`` infront of module name under ``modules``
section. ``modules_display`` section is used to display a text in the
side bar of SILPA main page. Tweak it if required.


.. warning::

 *normalizer* and *silpa_common* modules are helper modules which is
 required by the current modules.  Do not add a line to silpa.conf for
 this module. Its not a web module pure python module

VirtialEnv Instructions
-----------------------

If you are on Mac OS X or Linux, chances are that one of the following
two commands will work for you:

.. code-block:: shell-session

 $ sudo easy_install virtualenv

or even better:

.. code-block:: shell-session

 $ sudo pip install virtualenv

One of these will probably install virtualenv on your system. Maybe
itâ€™s even in your package manager. If you use Ubuntu, try:

.. code-block:: shell-session

 $ sudo apt-get install python-virtualenv

Once you have virtualenv installed, just fire up a shell-session and
create your own environment.

.. code-block:: shell-session

 $ git clone git://github.com/copyninja/Silpa-Flask.git
 $ cd Silpa-Flask
 $ virtualenv silpa

 New python executable in silpa/bin/python
 Installing distribute............done.


Now, whenever you want to work on a project, you only have to activate
the corresponding environment. On OS X and Linux, do the following:

.. code-block:: shell-session

 $ . silpa/bin/activate

If you are a Windows user, the following command is for you:

.. code-block:: shell-session

 $ silpa\scripts\activate.bat

Either way, you should now be using your virtualenv (notice how the
prompt of your shell-session has changed to show the active
environment).

Now you can just enter the following command to get Flask activated in
your virtualenv:

.. code-block:: shell-session

 $ pip install Flask

A few seconds later and you are good to go.

You can start the silpa application by
.. code-block:: shell-session

 python silpa.py
 Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Well not exactly. You will see error messages saying Failed to import
module xyz. That means you need to install the modules.  Here is an
example module installation for Soundex. Repeat this for other
modules.

.. code-block:: shell-session

 mkdir modules
 cd modules
 git clone git://github.com/copyninja/Soundex.git
 cd Soundex
 python setup.py install

And restart the server by just killing and running python silpa.py again.
